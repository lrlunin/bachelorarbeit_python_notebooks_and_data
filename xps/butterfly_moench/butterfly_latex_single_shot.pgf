%% Creator: Matplotlib, PGF backend
%%
%% To include the figure in your LaTeX document, write
%%   \input{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Make sure the required packages are loaded in your preamble
%%   \usepackage{pgf}
%%
%% Also ensure that all the required font packages are loaded; for instance,
%% the lmodern package is sometimes necessary when using math font.
%%   \usepackage{lmodern}
%%
%% Figures using additional raster images can only be included by \input if
%% they are in the same directory as the main LaTeX file. For loading figures
%% from other directories you can use the `import` package
%%   \usepackage{import}
%%
%% and then include the figures with
%%   \import{<path to file>}{<filename>.pgf}
%%
%% Matplotlib used the following preamble
%%   \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}\usepackage[output-decimal-marker={,}]{siunitx} \sisetup{per-mode=fraction, separate-uncertainty = true, locale = DE} \usepackage[acronym, toc, section=section, nonumberlist, nopostdot]{glossaries-extra}
